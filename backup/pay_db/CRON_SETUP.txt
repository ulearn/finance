CRONTAB SETUP FOR AUTOMATIC BACKUPS
====================================

To set up automated backups on the last Friday of each month:

1. Edit your crontab:
   crontab -e

2. Add ONE of these lines:

   Option A - Run daily at 2 AM (wrapper checks if it's last Friday):
   0 2 * * * /home/hub/public_html/fins/backup/pay_db/run-if-last-friday.sh

   Option B - Run only on Fridays at 2 AM (more efficient):
   0 2 * * 5 /home/hub/public_html/fins/backup/pay_db/run-if-last-friday.sh

   Option C - Manual runs only (no cron job):
   # Don't add anything to crontab, just run manually when needed

3. Save and exit

RECOMMENDED: Option B (Fridays at 2 AM)

The script automatically:
- Only runs if today is the last Friday of the month
- Keeps 14 most recent backups
- Logs all activity to backup.log
- Compresses backups with gzip (~260KB per backup)

MANUAL BACKUP:
To run a backup immediately:
cd /home/hub/public_html/fins/backup/pay_db
./backup-payroll.sh
